# Football-Game-Unity

The shootBall script is the game controller of a 3D football game I worked on back in early 
2021 as I was learning how to use the Unity game engine. I started this project after ditching
an earlier project that involved 3D animated characters.
This controller runs in Unity without errors however the code is inefficient and has much 
room for improvement. I plan on returning to this project one day and revamping it.
